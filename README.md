Doodle
======

Social Project -  Starting with a simple doodle drawing I would like to pass the drawing on to someone else and have them add to my drawing. I want to see what direction the drawing will take after it passes through hundreds or thousands of people. There are rules that I need to be able to enforce. 
Rules
1. Try to keep the project family friendly (No Pornography, Racist Images, etc.)
2. I need a copy of the project before doodles are added to it and after - This will allow me to track changes and ensure added images are not too inappropriate
3. I would like to track the changes so I can create a video of the progress and use the video to entice further participants

Any Help or ideas how I can accomplish this is greatly appriciated
